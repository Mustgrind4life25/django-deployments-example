how to setup my project to allow user who are connected to the database to login and logout:

the process involves:
-setting up login views
- using built-in decorators for access
- adding the login_url in settings 
- creating the login.html
- editing urls.py file

- open the settings file scroll to the bottom where the static url is located and type in:
LOGIN_URL = 'the templates path/name of the html file'

- go to the templates and create your login.html file
- add the extention to it from the base html
- code: {% extends buildapp/base.html %}
- add the body block tags so everything from base inside of the body block tags
- code: {% block body_block %}
		{% endblock %}

- go to the views.py file
- this is where the logic for everything for the login page is going to go
- we need to import a few of django built in functions 
- code to import:
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate,login,logout
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect, HttpResponse
from django.urls import reverse # use django.urls import reverse 
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required 

- dont call a view on of the import names django will get confused and mess up your project

- go to your urls add a url for logout page
